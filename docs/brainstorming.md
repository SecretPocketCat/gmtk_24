# ideas

- climbing (scaling) up, probably with a grapplehook or similar
- climbing + typing game
- fishing (scales)
- balancing scales (weight) - throw items at the scales (physics-based)
- musical scales (possibly just SFX)
- puzzle game in which the lvl/items grow/shrink in order to progress
  - after changing scale, the player can move somewhere, but can't push blocks anymore (too large) etc.
- puzzle game about climbing with a ladder
  - the ladder has to fit when moving thru rooms
  - the ladder can be used to climb walls
  - the ladder can be used as a bridge
- indirect control - climb with a massive machine by platforming around and controlling it by pressing buttons (think Lovers in a Dang. ST)
